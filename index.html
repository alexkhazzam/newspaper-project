            <h5 class="compromise_header">Background/Historical Circumstances</h5>
            <p class="compromise-text">
                On January 29, 1850, the United States initiated The Compromise of 1850. This political enactment consists of five laws—all of which supposedly deal with the issue of slavery and territorial expansion in the wake of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). Last year, in 1849, the state of California requested permission to enter the Union as a free state, potentially upsetting the balance between the free and slave states in the U.S. Senate. The Compromise of 1850 was created in the hopes of addressing this political and social division. The Compromise of 1850 was created by Kentucky State Senator Henry Clay, a statesman and member of the Whig Party.
            </p>
            <h5 class="compromise_header">What It Includes</h5>
            <p  class="compromise-text">
                - California is admitted as a “free state”<br>
                - Utah and New Mexico are allowed to decide for themselves whether to be a slave state or a free state (via popular sovereignty)<br>
                - New boundaries for Texas are defined following the Mexican-American War, removing the state’s claims to parts of New Mexico but awarding the state $10 million in compensation<br>
                - Makes it easier for slave owners to recover runways under the newly-amended Fugitive Slave Act of 1793; the act now requires citizens to assist in apprehending runaway slaves and denied enslaved people a right to trial by jury<br>
                - Slavery becomes permitted in Washington D.C., while the slave trade itself was abolished in our country’s capital
            </p>
            <h5 class="compromise_header">Opinion</h5>
            <p class="compromise-text">The Compromise of 1850 comes as a major disappointment to myself. The only way that this compromise fights against slavery is through admitting California as a "free state" to the Union. Although Utah and New Mexico can decide for themselves whether to be a slave or free state, it is almost certain that the majority of people will choose to be a "slave state." Both Utah and New Mexico are located in the South, and because there are a vast amount of plantations and farmable land, they would have greater need for slaves than most states. Clay basically asked a toddler if they would rather choose between a piece of candy or a salad; no toddler would ever choose the latter. As for the new boundaries of Texas, well, that has nothing to do with slavery so it does not make me feel better nor worse. Clay is despised by a lot of Illinois citizens, including myself, for amending the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. In no way, shape or form, am I happy about this; instead of making it easier for slave owners to recover runaway slaves, Clay should have made it the opposite. As for slavery becoming legalized in Washington D.C, that comes as a major blow to the "free states"; what good is the abolishment of the slave trade if slavery is still allowed?! This makes no sense. As of now, only about 1 of the 5 points that this Compromise addressed satisfy, and in turn, the state of Illinois. With tensions growing in the North, The Compromise of 1850 seems to be encouraging war rather than preventing it. The North has a right to be angry&mdash;just like myself&mdash;and all Congress does is kiss up to the South. This compromise has completely backfired on Clay, as its effects are exactly the opposite of what he intended. The Compromise of 1850 is starting to look a lot less like a compromise, and more like a one-sided set of laws. Henry Clay, I now speak directly to you: I am very disappointed in both you and the Compromise of 1850.</p>

    <h3 id="fugitive-header"  class="one-header">The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 (News Story)</h3>
    <h5 class="fugitive_header">Background/Historical Circumstances</h5>
    <p class="fugitive-text">To understand the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, one must also understand the past, and what led up to its creation. By 1843, every year, hundreds of slaves successfully escaped to the North, making slavery untenable in border states. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 required the return of runaway slaves by requiring authorities in free states to return fugitive slaves to their masters. Many Northern states, however, found ways to bypass this. As if this law was not already weak, in 1842, the Supreme Court case Priggish v. Pennsylvania determined that states did not have to offer aid in the recapturing of escaped slaves. </p>
    <h5 class="fugitive_header">Modern Facts</h5>
    <p class="fugitive-text">Following increased pressure from Southern politicians, congress passed a revised Fugitive Slave Act in 1850. The amendment of the Fugitive Slave Act is included in The Compromise of 1850, and forcibly compels citizens to assist in the capture of runaway slaves. The Fugitive Slave Act also denies enslaves people the right to a jury trial, while increasing the penalty for interfering with the rendition process to $1,000 and six months in jail. In order to ensure that citizens comply with this statute, the 1850 law also places control of individual cases in the hands of federal commissioners. These agents are paid more for returning a suspected runaway than for freeing them. </p>
    <h5 class="fugitive_header">Effects</h5>
    <p class="fugitive-text">States like Vermont and Wisconsin are in the middle of passing new measures intended to bypass and even nullify this law. Abolitionists in these states—and all over the country, for that matter—increased their efforts to assist runaways. All across the North, violent protests are underway. This anger stems from the fact that Northern states were coerced into protecting the institution of Southern slavery—an institution they despised. Furthermore, many northerners are claiming that the South is conspiring to spread slavery through federal coercion and force—regardless of Northerners’ opinions. An all-out Civil War seems more likely to occur with every passing day.</p>

    <h3 id="fugitive-header"  class="one-header">The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 (Feature Story: Human Interest)</h3>
    <p class="fugitive-text">
        First and foremost, allow me to say that I am completely against the immoral brutality against the African American race solely because of the color of their skin. These blacks have gone years of working on plantations for long hours, under brutal temperatures and conditions, with little-to-no wages. I am completely against that, even though I am a northern factory owner who employs slaves for my own work.<br>
      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;The horrific Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 indicates that slaves must be returned to their owners, even if they are in the north. Before this act, my workers were whites, who received wages. But now, the ‘slaves’ can receive no wages under this act. They must be subjective towards the white race and work for them under all conditions. I would rather not exploit slaves to do the work in factories that the whites are doing because they don’t even earn anything. Acts like this state that it is their mere obligation to work for their owners without being paid. I’d rather see whites being paid to do the hard labor in factories than see blacks without being paid a single dime. It is beneficial for me to have blacks in my factory because that’ll be more employees, but truthfully, I don’t enjoy it a single bit. My goal is to abolish slavery under all circumstances— regardless of what it may take.<br>
      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;One of the slaves who my friend from the south personally knows is a young man named Tyronne. Tyronne, at five years old, was separated from his mother and father when he was shipped to a different plantation than his parents. Tyronne has done nothing but work and work on plantations, giving every single bit of strength he’s got. Even though he’s completely innocent of his entire childhood, he still has to experience the conditions that an African American in modern society does. Of the people I know, Tyronne has had the most difficult childhood. He’s been doing everything to be sent to the north to be free, and he finally made it. He did it. But because of the—to say the least—unethical Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, his aspirations are completely irrelevant and insignificant. Despite where he is, he must be sent to his owner— me. <br>
      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;I try my best to make sure slaves like Tyronne don’t have to endure the conditions they did in the south, but acts like this make it undoubtedly difficult for me to do so. Regardless of our color, we must unite together to fight against racism towards any particular race— in this case, African Americans. Just because of the family some were born into, they have no human rights and are subjective and inferior to the white race in all circumstances. Everyone deserves equal treatment, and that is why I unite with Tyronne and all the other African Americans to rebel against the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. We must act now, for it can be too late if we don’t. <br><br>

        <h3 id="tom-header"  class="one-header">Uncle Tom’s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe In 1852 (Editorial)</h3>
        <p class="tom-text">
            Josiah Henson, also known as Uncle Tom, was born in 1789 near Port Tobacco, Maryland. Henson’s first memory was of his father being whipped to the extent that his ear was cut off and he was sold south. The reason why his father had this brutal whipping was that he reasonably striked a man who tried to rape his own wife. I don’t believe there’s a single thing wrong with that. During his childhood, Henson was unfortunately separated from his mother and sold to a child trafficker, and the situation only exacerbated as he soon became ill. The slave trader offered Henson to his mother’s owner at an unbelievably cheap price free of charge if he died, and if he were to survive, he would be able to do some work. <br><br>

            However, Henson not only survived, but he also rose to the position of farm overseer and Riley’s market man in Washington D.C.. After earning a $350 down payment on his emancipation—about three years’ wages for a white farm laborer—Riley sent Henson to visit his brother Amos, who unexpectedly attempted to sell him south to New Orleans. Consequently, Henson tried his best to avoid this horrific act through a surprising turn of events. Riley’s nephew was Amos Junior, the young man who was to sell Henson, fortunately inherited malaria. Instead of leaving the teenager to die, Henson heroically loaded him on a steamship, then returned north. <br><br>
  
  Years later, in 1830, Henson escaped Kentucky by water. Travelling at night, Henson, his wife, and his four children made the 600-mile journey to the Canadian border on foot. While the escapees approached the Niagara River, a Scottish captain sympathetically paid to send the guiltless Henson family across. 
  <br><br>
  But Tom is soon caught after escaping. While being transported to New Orleans by boat, Tom once again—heroically—saves the life of Little Eva, whose grateful father—as a slave owner—then purchases Tom. Nonetheless, right before Eva is about to unfortunately die due to health problems, on her deathbed, she asks her father to free all slaves, but the father is killed once his courageous promise to Eva is discovered. After a number of events, Simon Legree ends up becoming Tom’s brutal slaveholder, who vigorously kills him after he refuses to confess about the whereabouts of the runaway slaves.  <br><br>
  
  Instead of exploiting his business and oratory skills to just build a life for himself, he adamantly advocated for equality of opportunity, did whatever it took to make sure his friends and family were safe, planted churches, and defended himself against imprisonment after supporting families whose sons fought in the Civil War. With the help of American supporters and British Christian philanthropists, he built a settlement for African American refugees, fundraised for black social enterprises, and even built a school complacent with equality. <br><br>

This political cartoon is describing the turmoil between the north and south during the voting period while Kansas was still an undecided territory. Men from Missouri came to support the proslavery side; they committed horrible crimes in order to achieve their goals, violently lashing out at anyone who stood in their way. Andrew Reeder, the original territorial governer, supported slavery before witnessing the brutality of these Missouri men. Hoping to have the legislative action overturn, he sought out president Franklin Pierce. Pierce, after listening to Reeder’s plea, decided to replace Reeder with Shanon Wilson, current Ohio governor, in order to prevent growing conflicts between the north and south. Quite ironically, Shanon’s appointment actually ended up causing more strife; Shanon enforced the actions of pro-slavery supporters, which—unsurprisingly—angered the anti-slavery supporters. This led to further violence which was encouraged on the proslavery side, pro slavery supporters started raiding towns with majority anti slavery supporters. On May 21, eight hundred pro-slavery men attacked the town of Laurence burning down houses plundering stores and burning down the governors home. The anti-slavery people didn’t take that laying down so their retaliated which resulted in a minor civil war which was named “Bleeding Kansas.” May 24,1856, marked the first day of bleeding Kansas, John Brown, who was raised in Ohio, four of his sons, and two additional men rode into Pottawatomie Creek, Kansas, a village of several slave-owning families. Brown and his followers attacked five men in front of their wives and children and hacked them to death with swords. Bleeding Kansas ended in 1865.

        <h3 id="formation-header"  class="one-header">Formation of the Republican Party in 1854 (News Story)</h3>
        <p class="formation-text">
            On the 20th of March 1854, the Republican Party was formed. These Republicans instantly gained supporters from the North due to their abolitionist beliefs as a whole. At the first Republican Convention in 1856, the Republicans nominated John C. Fremont with intentions for Congress to abolish slavery in the territories, one of the North’s strongest beliefs, as the North was completely against slavery while the South was the opposite. Frémont somehow ended up carrying 11 Northern states and received nearly 2/5 of the electoral vote. In the first four years of its existence, the Republican Party was easily able to become the main opposition to the dominant Democratic Party, as the Republican Party was essentially everything the Democratic Party wasn’t and the new party replaced the former Whigs. Around 1860, the Democrats split up due to different outlooks on the topic of slavery. Because of this, Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln was able to win the presidency, winning 18 Northern states and receiving a whopping 60 percent of the electoral vote but only 40 percent of the popular vote. This was probably because Lincoln was favored by not only antislavery voters in the North, but to business owners in the East and farmers in the Midwest. By the time of Lincoln’s inauguration as president, seven Southern states had dropped from the Union, which caused the Civil War. Around 1863, Abraham Lincoln approved the famous Emancipation Proclamation which declared slaves to be “forever free”. Later on in 1865, the permanent abolition of slavery as a whole was formally embedded in the Constitution with the addition of the 13th Amendment. Lincoln is now known as not only the man but also a hero, who destroyed the ideology of slavery; and an amazing white man who was very determined and confident in a racial balance between the whites and African Americans. The formation of the Republican Party is a very significant event of the history of the United States.

        <h3 id="dred-header"  class="one-header">Dred Scott v. Sanford in 1857 (Editorial)</h3>
        <p class="dred-text">
            Here in the Northern Region, living in a free state is amazing. No slavery means no innocent blacks suffering at the hands of racist and abusive plantation owners. An innocent African American named Dred Scott sued John Sanford because he was holding him illegally. Mr. Scott was stripped of his rights, and was taken against his will to a free state. I don't understand why this case is even a question. A nasty slave owner brought someone he calls ‘property’ into a free state. He literally broke the one rule that was agreed on between the North and South. And that brings me to the decision of this case. The outcome of the Dred Scott v. Sanford case is truly absurd and insane. The fact that a slave should be considered as property and therefore unable to file a lawsuit is outrageous. Due to this decision, these slave owners can now go around everywhere saying that the Supreme Court supports the ideology of slavery. Here in the North, us free states despise the idea of slavery, and the fact that our sentimental and hard worked Missouri Compromise is gone does not make any sense. Now that our meaningful compromise has been deemed unconstitutional, watch how these racist scums take advantage of popular sovereignty with fraud. A simple ballot miscount is all it takes for a disgusting idea to rush back into our prospering and beautiful free state. All that the outcome of this case does, is create more division instead of unity. Why should the color of someone’s skin even determine if they have rights or not in the first place? Slavery is a cancer that runs through the Southern region of the United States, and the amount of division between the North and South is now entirely unprecedented. At the rate that we’re going, the result of this division will result in bloodshed. These animals are going to assume that we are anti-Southerner instead of anti-slavery, and mark my words; a war is inevitable. All due to one biased, racist, and disgusting decision.

        <h3 id="lincoln-header"  class="one-header">Lincoln-Douglas Debate of 1858 (News Story)</h3>
        <p class="lincoln-text">The Lincoln-Douglas Debates are seven debates taking place during the senatorial campaign in Illinois. These debates are between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, regarding the issue of slavery extension. This issue was originally resolved 40 years ago by the Missouri Compromise which created an even balance between slave and non slave states in America, but new territories were acquired by the Mexican War which has caused the issue of slavery extention to arise again. The Compromise of 1850 resolved this issue, but this resolution was unfortunately only temporary. Additionally, the Kansas-Nebraska Act also brought this issue back, which is sponsored by Stephen Douglas. Douglas wants popular sovereignty, where the people located in each of the territories would decide whether or not slavery should be allowed in their territory, rather than allowing Congress to decide on behalf of each territory. As a Republican, Abraham Lincoln contradicts this because the Republican Party formed in order to keep slavery out of the West. Therefore, now these debates between Lincoln and Douglas are occurring. These debates are debating about the issue regarding slavery extension which has previously divided the nation and has even threatened the existence of the union as a whole. Therefore, these debates can cause more problems and cause even more of a divide in the nation. Overall, the issues which are being brought up and discussed during these debates are extremely significant and the issues that are being discussed will possibly cause more questions to arise in the future.
