            <h3 id="compromise-header">The Compromise of 1850 (Editorial)</h3>
            <h5 class="compromise_header">Overview</h5>
            <p class="compromise-text">
                On January 29, 1850, our great nation initiated The Compromise of 1850. This political enactment consisted of five laws—all of which dealt with the issue of slavery and territorial expansion in the wake of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). Last year, in 1849, the state of California requested permission to enter the Union as a free state, potentially upsetting the balance between the free and slave states in the U.S. Senate. The Compromise of 1850 was created in order to address this political and social division.   
            </p>
            <h5 class="compromise_header">What It Includes</h5>
            <p  class="compromise-text">
                - California was admitted as a “free state”<br>
                - Utah and New Mexico were allowed to decide for themselves whether to be a slave state or a free state (via popular sovereignty)<br>
                - New boundaries for Texas were defined following the Mexican-American War, removing the state’s claims to parts of New Mexico but awarding the state $10 million in compensation<br>
                - Made it easier for slave owners to recover runways under the newly-amended Fugitive Slave Act of 1793; the act now required citizens to assist in apprehending runaway slaves and denied enslaved people a right to trial by jury<br>
                - Slavery became permitted in Washington D.C., while the slave trade itself was abolished in our country’s capital
            </p>
            <h5 class="compromise_header">Who</h5>
            <p  class="compromise-text">
                The Compromise of 1850 was created by Kentucky State Senator Henry Clay, a leading statesman and member of the Whig Party. Clay had already fashioned a name for himself—“The Great Compromiser”—that reflected his work on the Missouri Compromise of 1850. In order to prevent the seeds of a Civil War from being sown, Clay enacted this Compromise.

    <h3 id="fugitive-header">The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 (Feature Story: Human Interest)</h3>
    <p class="fugitive-text">
        First and foremost, allow me to say that I am completely against the immoral brutality against the African American race solely because of the color of their skin. These blacks have gone years of working on plantations for long hours, under brutal temperatures and conditions, with little-to-no wages. I am completely against that, even though I am a northern factory owner who employs slaves for my own work.<br>
      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;The horrific Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 indicates that slaves must be returned to their owners, even if they are in the north. Before this act, my workers were whites, who received wages. But now, the ‘slaves’ can receive no wages under this act. They must be subjective towards the white race and work for them under all conditions. I would rather not exploit slaves to do the work in factories that the whites are doing because they don’t even earn anything. Acts like this state that it is their mere obligation to work for their owners without being paid. I’d rather see whites being paid to do the hard labor in factories than see blacks without being paid a single dime. It is beneficial for me to have blacks in my factory because that’ll be more employees, but truthfully, I don’t enjoy it a single bit. My goal is to abolish slavery under all circumstances— regardless of what it may take.<br>
      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;One of the slaves who my friend from the south personally knows is a young man named Tyronne. Tyronne, at five years old, was separated from his mother and father when he was shipped to a different plantation than his parents. Tyronne has done nothing but work and work on plantations, giving every single bit of strength he’s got. Even though he’s completely innocent of his entire childhood, he still has to experience the conditions that an African American in modern society does. Of the people I know, Tyronne has had the most difficult childhood. He’s been doing everything to be sent to the north to be free, and he finally made it. He did it. But because of the—to say the least—unethical Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, his aspirations are completely irrelevant and insignificant. Despite where he is, he must be sent to his owner— me. <br>
      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;I try my best to make sure slaves like Tyronne don’t have to endure the conditions they did in the south, but acts like this make it undoubtedly difficult for me to do so. Regardless of our color, we must unite together to fight against racism towards any particular race— in this case, African Americans. Just because of the family some were born into, they have no human rights and are subjective and inferior to the white race in all circumstances. Everyone deserves equal treatment, and that is why I unite with Tyronne and all the other African Americans to rebel against the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. We must act now, for it can be too late if we don’t. <br><br>

        <h3 id="tom-header">Uncle Tom’s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe In 1852 (Advertisement)</h3>
        <p class="tom-text">
            Josiah Henson, also known as Uncle Tom, was born in 1789 near Port Tobacco, Maryland. Henson’s first memory was of his father being whipped to the extent that his ear was cut off and he was sold south. The reason why his father had this brutal whipping was that he reasonably striked a man who tried to rape his own wife. I don’t believe there’s a single thing wrong with that. During his childhood, Henson was unfortunately separated from his mother and sold to a child trafficker, and the situation only exacerbated as he soon became ill. The slave trader offered Henson to his mother’s owner at an unbelievably cheap price free of charge if he died, and if he were to survive, he would be able to do some work. <br><br>

            However, Henson not only survived, but he also rose to the position of farm overseer and Riley’s market man in Washington D.C.. After earning a $350 down payment on his emancipation—about three years’ wages for a white farm laborer—Riley sent Henson to visit his brother Amos, who unexpectedly attempted to sell him south to New Orleans. Consequently, Henson tried his best to avoid this horrific act through a surprising turn of events. Riley’s nephew was Amos Junior, the young man who was to sell Henson, fortunately inherited malaria. Instead of leaving the teenager to die, Henson heroically loaded him on a steamship, then returned north. <br><br>
  
  Years later, in 1830, Henson escaped Kentucky by water. Travelling at night, Henson, his wife, and his four children made the 600-mile journey to the Canadian border on foot. While the escapees approached the Niagara River, a Scottish captain sympathetically paid to send the guiltless Henson family across. 
  <br><br>
  But Tom is soon caught after escaping. While being transported to New Orleans by boat, Tom once again—heroically—saves the life of Little Eva, whose grateful father—as a slave owner—then purchases Tom. Nonetheless, right before Eva is about to unfortunately die due to health problems, on her deathbed, she asks her father to free all slaves, but the father is killed once his courageous promise to Eva is discovered. After a number of events, Simon Legree ends up becoming Tom’s brutal slaveholder, who vigorously kills him after he refuses to confess about the whereabouts of the runaway slaves.  <br><br>
  
  Instead of exploiting his business and oratory skills to just build a life for himself, he adamantly advocated for equality of opportunity, did whatever it took to make sure his friends and family were safe, planted churches, and defended himself against imprisonment after supporting families whose sons fought in the Civil War. With the help of American supporters and British Christian philanthropists, he built a settlement for African American refugees, fundraised for black social enterprises, and even built a school complacent with equality. <br><br>

            This political cartoon is describing the turmoil between the north and south during the voting period while Kansas was still an undecided territory. Men from Missouri came to support the proslavery side; they committed horrible crimes in order to achieve their goals, violently lashing out at anyone who stood in their way. Andrew Reeder, the original territorial governer, supported slavery before witnessing the brutality of these Missouri men. Hoping to have the legislative action overturn, he sought out president Franklin Pierce. Pierce, after listening to Reeder’s plea, decided to replace Reeder with Shanon Wilson, current Ohio governor, in order to prevent growing conflicts between the north and south. Quite ironically, Shanon’s appointment actually ended up causing more strife; Shannon (this is where u left off) enforced the actions of pro-slavery supporters, which—unsurprisingly—angered the anti-slavery supporters. Still thinking that the anti-slavery supporters have the majority form their own legislature to reflect the that. This led to further violence which was encouraged on the proslavery side, pro slavery supporters started raiding towns with majority anti slavery supporters. On May 21, eight hundred pro-slavery men attacked the town of Laurence burning down houses plundering stores and burning down the governors home. The anti-slavery people didn’t take that laying down so their retaliated which resulted in a minor civil war which was named “Bleeding Kansas.” May 24,1856, marked the first day of bleeding Kansas, John Brown, who was raised in Ohio, four of his sons, and two additional men rode into Pottawatomie Creek, Kansas, a village of several slave-owning families. Brown and his followers attacked five men in front of their wives and children and hacked them to death with swords. Bleeding Kansas ended in 1865.
